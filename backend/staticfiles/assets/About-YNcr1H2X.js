The prior is calculated separately for all courses and all courses within a department (sums and sums of squares for variance). We assume variance decreases with observations, so observed variance is the reciprocal of number of responses. Finally, the Empirical Bayes score is obtained by linearly combining the observed mean and the prior mean using the shrinkage weight. The values we calculate should be repeatable by any scrapist, with minor variation due to how the rare missing/invalid/funky data is handled.',e.jsx("b",{children:" In other words, the rating gains confidence the more ratings there are.

For example, if the weighted score for a course's materials is in the 47th percentile, it would receive a B-. A course with a weighted score in 61st percentile gets a C. These letters exist purely for easy comparison and are not meant to be taken as a "grade" or "evaluation" of the course, other than how past students have filled out the QGuide. They exist so that you can eyeball the data and see how a courses' score compares, since a number like 4.32 has little intuitive meaning.

Also, even if you can, you can't compare their QScores, unless you open a ton of tabs and flip through them back and forth (which we've done many times before).
