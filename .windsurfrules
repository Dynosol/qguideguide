Workspace Rule for Code-Editing AI:

Stack Overview:

Frontend: React with Vite for bundling and development.

Backend: Django for the API and server-side logic.

Database: PostgreSQL hosted on Neon.tech.

Caching: Redis for caching (hosted on Render.com).

Deployment: Render.com for hosting both frontend and backend services.

Environment Setup:

Always use the Python virtual environment (venv) located in the backend/ directory for running the Django backend. Activate it using source backend/venv/bin/activate (Linux/Mac) or backend\venv\Scripts\activate (Windows).

Ensure all Python dependencies are installed using pip install -r backend/requirements.txt.

For the frontend, always use npm install or yarn install in the frontend/ directory to install dependencies.
